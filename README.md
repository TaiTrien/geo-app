- UIs: Widgets and Pages folder contains reusable UI element.
- Controller: Will be handled business logic. Controller's responsibilities are receiving data from UI, validate and send to repo, also receiving data from repo then send to UIs.
- Repo: Responsible are receiving data from controller, send to data layer (local storage, server, cloud, etc) and clean data before send it back to controller if repo receives data from data layer.
- Model: Responsible to converting from json to class instancee that can help develop more efficient.
# Design pattern used 
## Dependecy Injection
- Explanation: Each **controller** will be put in **binding** through dependencies function. Every time, you need controller to handle data just injecting the **binding** that put **controller** through **AppPage**. Then using Get.find() to get the controller instance
- Advantage: If there are more one places need using controller, just need inject its instance not create a new one.
## Factory 
- Use to create data models
